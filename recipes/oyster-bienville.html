        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and sprinkle a good layer of 
                rock salt over a sheet pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook bacon in a small, non-stick skillet over medium heat until brown 
                and crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon from the skillet to a plate and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the same skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter, and cook mushrooms in butter and
                rendered bacon fat until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add shrimp and continue cooking
                until shrimp is opaque and firm, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove mushroom
                and shrimp from the skillet, and keep warm. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain oysters, reserving 1/2 cup of the liquor (see note). Nestle 12 oyster half shells into
                rock salt on the prepared pan, and place an oyster in each half shell.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a 9-inch skillet over medium heat.
                Saute white parts of green onions, for about 3 minutes. Add minced garlic and
                cook until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Slowly add in flour and stir to make
                a smooth mixture. Remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Break egg yolk in a small bowl, and stir in parsley and cream.
                Stir yolk mixture into green onion and flour mixture until well blended.
                Add oyster liquor; return the skillet to the burnet over low heat, and cook,
                stirring continuously, until the sauce is thick and creamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add mushroom and shrimp mixture, Parmesan cheese, and salt to the sauce.
                Stir until cheese is melted and well blended.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon sauce over oysters. Sprinkle with reserved cooked bacon pieces and
                seasoned bread crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Garnish with reserved chopped green onion tops and fresh parsley springs.
                Serve immediately with lemon wedges.
            </li>
